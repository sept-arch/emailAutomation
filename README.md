# Email Automation Script
## Abstract
 - Currently, emails are sent out to recruiters to invite them to host a meeting for my organization.
 - A random email from a list of contacts is picked from the company, and then this process is repeated for every company
 - Email follows a format: introduction of the officer sending the correspondence, introduction of the organization, why we are interested in the company, available dates, and then reiteration of how much we (the org) would love to have them
 - The format is followed verbatim, so by switching keywords such as mentions of the company name, emails could be reduced to full conversations with company contacts
## Objective
- Web application that automates the email sending process
  - Specifically, manually gather company, name, email, and parse data with pandas
  - Provide a simple UI to select a recruiter from list
## Stack
 - Backend: Python, Pandas, Google API
 - Frontend: Streamlit
## Notes
- Only to be used for recruiters not previously contacted
